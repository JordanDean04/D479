                <h3>Hotels</h3>
                <p>Taniti also houses several higher-end hotels that are more affordable than Yellowleaf Bay, but just as nice. Notable among these is the Island Inn, right in the heart of Tahiti City. 
                    Most of these hotels are located in the city and are not far from the nightlife or dining options.
