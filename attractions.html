                <h3>Mt. Ahuhai Volcano</h3>
                <p>The mystical Mt. Ahuhai Volcano has towered over Taniti since it's very beginning. Local folktales have been passed down through the generations about a devastating eruption that nearly wiped out a village on the island. 
                    You can explore these folklores or the recorded history by visiting the Mt. Ahuhai Historical Museum, reachable by the Mt. Ahuhai Scenic Hiking Route.
                    Bike, Hike, or take a helicopter tour to the summit and experience the most breathtaking look of our lovely island.

                <h3>Beaches</h3>
                <p>Taniti is home to a number of beautiful beaches. The busiest spot in town is the Taniti Beach, home to a beautiful view of the Pacific Ocean and crystal clear waters.
                    For a more quiet spot, visit Yellowleaf Bay Beach in the shadow of our four-star resort. Yellowleaf offers several spots of shades from the palm and coconut trees sprouting from the sand, and is the ideal spot for a more relaxed vacation.
                    Rounding out our more prominent beaches is Lava Lagoon, a beach at the base of Mt. Ahuhai. This spot is ideal for surfers and swimmers, hosting some of the best waves you can ride and numerous snorkeling and fishing activities.

                <h3>Rainforest</h3>
                <p>The lush Taniti Rainforest is a must-see stop on your island vacation. The rainforest is located at the heart of the island and is home to numerous exotic animals and some more traditional inhabitants.
                    You can explore any of our rainforest tours, including delving through some deep cave systems. The rainforest features numerous waterfalls that are all safe to swim in, as well!
                    Finally, make sure you zipline over the rainforest in the most thrilling attraction on the island.

                <h3>More Attractions</h3>
                <p>The beaches, volcano, and rainforest aren't the things to do when you stop by. Tahiti City is the hub of the island and features an abundance of activities, such as nightclubs, breweries, art galleries, and even a movie theater.
                    Most of our restaurants are also located inside of Tahiti City, so be sure to stop by and grab some grub if you get hungry!
                    Feel free to take one of our helicopter tours to fly high above the city, alongside the volcano and rainforest as well. This will give you an electrifying look of the most beautiful island in the world.
